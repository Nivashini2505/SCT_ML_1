# SCT_ML_1 - House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project predicts the prices of houses based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The linear regression model is implemented using Python and trained on a Kaggle dataset to make accurate predictions of house prices.
